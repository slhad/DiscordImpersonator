## This is the only way

Use discord api with your personal token and risk getting banned

## Userscript

As it a self-bot is against Discord policy, a userscript is most likely to be more "safe" as the goal is to just type in the chanel open and type on the enter key
And it's also not possible because there is not data from an input text box send to discord server, they manage keyboard event directly to create a div textarea with your key event

## Typescript project
This is a POC on how to use your personal discord token and do a self-bot which is TOTALLY AGAINST DISCORD POLICY
Useful to post/say/publish things under your discord user

It was going to use oauth2/client_grant_credentials to list guilds->chanels and then post a message on a specific chanel but it would be doing to much api request to be "safe"
